Required Changes for Version 2
The English speaker and the Spanish speaker are on two separate phones.
The English user can
hear the original Spanish
read the original Spanish
hear the interpreted English
read the translated English
The Spanish user can
hear the original English
read the original English
hear the interpreted Spanish
read the translated Spanish
The spoken English and Spanish are transmitted as a binary stream via web sockets (that needs an intermediary server) to the other phone, i.e. the speaker's voice is streamed as if it were a podcast. The other user has the option to play it or not. 
You may replace any janky raw web APIs from version 1 with nice third party solutions if you wish.
